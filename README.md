### Hi, I am Loukas ðŸ‘‹
I am an evolutionary biologist who is working in the interface between experimental evolution :man_scientist: and data science :man_technologist:, and loves coding in R. I am currently a postdoc at the [Rainey Lab](http://micropop.evolbio.mpg.de/) at the [Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology](https://www.evolbio.mpg.de/2169/en) in PlÃ¶n, Germany. I am passionate about making science open, and for this, I am sharing every bit of a helpful code that I write.
